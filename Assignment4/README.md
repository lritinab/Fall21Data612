This Assingment shows different visualization utilizing seaborn package.

The first visualization is a scatter plot matrix of 7 variables from the dataset. The matrix is good for showing correlation. A scatter plot is good for showing correlation as well as if there is any trends. 

The next is a boxplot that shows the distribution of wins by Team Rank. Boxplot is good to compare distribution of multiple datasets or different groups in one dataset.

I then show a univariate histogram for the distribution of fielding percentage for the Detriot Tigers.

For the categorical data, League Wins, I used a bar chart.

I also show a multivariate scatterplot of a paired-down dataset for just the Detroit Tigers.

Lastly I want to see if there are any trends in fielding percentage by error and grouped by divisionID.
