DATA 612: Assignment 3

This folder works with the dataset provided by the author of the "Easy And Fun With BeautifulSoup". The data are extracted from the Yahoo Finance website and include 90 days of data from November 21, 2019 until April 28, 2020.

In the Jupiter notebook, I convert the date column to a datetime formate and tried to perfrom a conversion from days to months using basic arithmatic. This did not work. Attempted various tries with pandas timedelta and datetime libs but had to use numpy to complete the assignment.
