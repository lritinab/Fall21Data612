This Assingment shows merging of data by key ids and removing the rows that have NaN value. I would like to play with this a little more becuase I dropped a lot of data by removing any row with NaN value. I would like to first create a fuction to run on the duplicate columns of 'G', 'lgID', 'SB' and 'CS' for it to first check to see which side (right or left) has NaN and then fill the side that has the missing value. If both sides are missing then that Row will be dropped.
